# Antiforensic-image-splicing-resnet-inceptionnet-keras-python
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to detect image splicing, a specific type of image forgery. By leveraging advanced neural network architectures, the model classifies images as either forged or authentic, contributing to the field of counter forensic techniques.
